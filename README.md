## Getting started

You will need the following general tools:

- A Python interpreter installed. [3.8.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/) is preffered.

- A text editor: preferably [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

- Extensions such as [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Running the backend project

- Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ioet/python-pizza-planet.git
```

- Create a virtual environment in the root folder of the project

```bash
make create-venv
```

- Activate the virtual environment (In vscode if you select the virtual env for your project it will activate once you open a new console window)

_For linux/MacOS users:_

```bash
make run-venv
```

_For windows users:_

```cmd
\path\to\env\Scripts\activate
```

- Install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
make install-only-requirements
```

- Start the database (Only needed for the first run):

```bash
make install-db
```

- Seed database:
```bash
    make seed
```

- Run hooks (Only needed for the first run):

```bash
make hooks
```

- Delete hooks (if needed, run this command to delete the hooks)
```bash
make delete-hooks
```


- If you want to use the hot reload feature set FLASK_ENV before running the project:

_For linux/MacOS users:_

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development 
```

_For windows users:_

```CMD
set FLASK_ENV=development
```

- Run the project with:

```bash
make run
```

## Running the frontend

- Clone git UI submodule

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

- Install Live Server extension if you don't have it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on VSCode Quick Open (`Ctrl + P`)

```bash
ext install ritwickdey.LiveServer
```

- To run the frontend, start `ui/index.html` file with Live Server (Right click `Open with Live Server`)

- **Important Note** You have to open vscode in the root folder of the project.

- **To avoid CORS errors** start the backend before the frontend, some browsers have CORS issues otherwise

### Testing the backend

- Make sure that you have `pytest` installed

- Run the test command

```bash
python3 manage.py test
```
